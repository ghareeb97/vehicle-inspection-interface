# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates an interactive vehicle inspection interface using a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Users can click on different parts of a vehicle SVG diagram to report damage using standardized damage categories (Dent, Scratches, Rust, Broken, Chips). The interface replicates the functionality of a paper-based vehicle inspection form in a digital, interactive format.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a vehicle part THEN the system SHALL highlight the part and display a tooltip with the part name
2. WHEN a user clicks on a vehicle part THEN the system SHALL open a damage marking interface for that specific part
3. WHEN a part has damage marked THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the damage on the SVG using color coding or symbols

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to mark damage using standardized damage categories, so that I can consistently document vehicle condition using industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a damage category is selected THEN the system SHALL allow multiple damage types per part
3. WHEN damage is marked THEN the system SHALL display the damage category letter on or near the affected part on the SVG

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to see all marked damage at a glance, so that I can quickly review the overall vehicle condition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN damage is marked on parts THEN the system SHALL display damage indicators directly on the vehicle SVG
2. WHEN viewing the inspection THEN the system SHALL provide a summary list of all damaged parts and their damage types
3. WHEN hovering over damage indicators THEN the system SHALL show detailed damage information in a tooltip

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to add remarks and notes, so that I can provide additional context about the vehicle condition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting an inspection THEN the system SHALL provide a remarks text area for general observations
2. WHEN adding remarks THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited text input for detailed descriptions
3. WHEN saving remarks THEN the system SHALL preserve the text for inclusion in reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to clear or modify damage markings, so that I can correct mistakes during the inspection process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on a marked part THEN the system SHALL allow editing or removing existing damage markings
2. WHEN removing damage THEN the system SHALL clear all visual indicators for that part
3. WHEN modifying damage THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicators accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to check vehicle accessories and equipment, so that I can verify the presence and condition of all required items.

2. WHEN checking each item THEN the system SHALL provide three status options: Available, Good, Damaged
3. WHEN an item is marked as damaged THEN the system SHALL allow specifying the damage type using the standard categories (D, S, R, K, C)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want the interface to work as a single HTML file, so that I can easily deploy and use it without complex setup requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL function as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
2. WHEN the file is opened in a web browser THEN the system SHALL load and display the vehicle inspection interface without external dependencies
